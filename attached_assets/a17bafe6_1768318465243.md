# MaxClaim v3.1 - COMPLETE BUSINESS MODEL (REVISED)
**Free Consumer Advocacy Tool + B2B Ad Network + Affiliate Commission Model**

---

## CORE BUSINESS MODEL

**MaxClaim is a FREE consumer advocacy tool funded by four aligned revenue streams:**

1. **B2B Ad Network** - Contractors/trades pay for geo-weighted visibility (name-your-price bidding)
2. **Advocate Affiliate Commissions** - Advocates/agents earn 15%-35% recurring on contractor signups
3. **B2B SaaS** - Licensing to adjuster firms, public adjusters, agencies (future)
4. **Organization Partnerships** - Free listings, sponsorships, grants (future)

---

## REVENUE STREAM 1: B2B AD NETWORK (Primary Revenue)

### Industry Context
Contractors typically spend:
- **Google Ads:** $500–$3,000+/month for 5–15 leads (≈ $50–$200 per lead)
- **Lead aggregators (Angi, HomeAdvisor):** $50–$150 per shared lead
- **Local Facebook ads:** $20–$50 per click, low-quality leads

**MaxClaim's advantage:** Same contractors can participate at **1/3 to 1/10 the cost** through the weighted ad model.

### Pricing Model: "Name Your Price" + Geographic Weighting

Contractors set their own bid (suggested tiers, but not mandatory):

```
SUGGESTED TIERS (Soft Guidance, Not Hard Limits)
├─ Basic: $20/month suggested
├─ Standard: $35/month suggested
├─ Premium: $50/month suggested
└─ Custom: Contractors can bid $15–$100+ as they choose

VISIBILITY ALGORITHM
├─ Premium Tier (>$40/mo): 25–30% of rotations
├─ Standard Tier ($20–40): 15–20% of rotations
├─ Basic Tier ($15–20): 8–12% of rotations
├─ Free Listing: Non-profits, govt, legal (0% ad rotation, 100% directory)

GEOGRAPHIC MULTIPLIER
├─ High-demand metros (Austin 78701, Houston 77002, Dallas 75201, etc.):
│  └─ 1.2x visibility boost (encouraging participation in disaster-hit zones)
├─ Rural areas: 1.15x boost (prioritizes underserved contractors)
└─ Minority-owned / family-owned: 1.2x boost (competitive fairness)

FIRST-MONTH INCENTIVE (Initial Onboarding)
├─ Month 1: FREE (no charge)
├─ Month 2: Pay once, get 2 months (50% off annualized)
│  Example: $35/mo tier → Pay $35 in Month 2, get 8 weeks of visibility
└─ Month 3+: Full monthly rate

ANNUAL PREPAY DISCOUNT
├─ Pay 10 months upfront → Get 12 months of service
└─ 16.7% bulk discount encourages longer commitments
```

### Financial Model: Ad Network (Conservative Scenario)

**Very Conservative (Year 1, Month 6-12 Average):**
- Active contractors: **200** (spread across Austin, Houston, Dallas)
- Effective average price after first-month-free & promos: **$25/mo**
- Monthly recurring revenue: 200 × $25 = **$5,000/mo**
- Annual from ads: **$60K**

This is **still 90% cheaper** than what a contractor pays for comparable Google Ads.

**Realistic Conservative (Year 1, Month 9-12 Average):**
- Active contractors: **400** nationwide (expanding regionally)
- Effective average price: **$30/mo** (promos taper, renewals at full price)
- Monthly recurring revenue: 400 × $30 = **$12,000/mo**
- Annual from ads: **$144K**

**Stretch (Year 2 start, scaling):**
- Active contractors: **600–800** (disaster events drive signups)
- Average price: **$32–35/mo**
- Monthly recurring revenue: 700 × $33.5 = **$23,450/mo**
- Annual: **~$280K**

---

## REVENUE STREAM 2: ADVOCATE AFFILIATE COMMISSIONS (Recurring Passive Income)

### Advocate Structure: "Micro-Entrepreneurs"

Advocates are community leaders, salespeople, or advocates in their region. They earn **residual commissions** like insurance agents—**as long as the contractor they referred stays on the platform**.

### Commission Tiers

```
AFFILIATE COMMISSION MODEL (Recurring, Residual)

TIER 1: STARTER ADVOCATE (Default)
├─ Initial signup bonus: $0 (no upfront cost to be an advocate)
├─ Per-contractor-signup commission: 15% of first 3 months
│  Example: Contractor signs up at $35/mo
│  Advocate earns: $35 × 0.15 = $5.25 × 3 months = $15.75 upfront
├─ Renewal commission: 15% recurring, every month contractor renews
│  Example: Month 4, contractor auto-renews at $35/mo
│  Advocate earns: $35 × 0.15 = $5.25
├─ Monthly passive: If 10 contractors sign up, ~$52.50 baseline + renewals

TIER 2: STANDARD ADVOCATE (After 5+ active contractors)
├─ Per-contractor-signup bonus: 20% of first 6 months
│  Example: $35/mo contractor = $42 upfront
├─ Renewal commission: 20% recurring (every month)
│  Example: Month 7 onwards = $7/mo per contractor
├─ Growth incentive: Recruit another advocate, earn 5% of their revenue

TIER 3: ELITE ADVOCATE (After 20+ active contractors)
├─ Per-contractor-signup bonus: 25% of first 12 months
│  Example: $35/mo contractor = $105 upfront
├─ Renewal commission: 25% recurring (every month forever)
│  Example: Month 13 onwards = $8.75/mo per contractor indefinitely
├─ Recruitment bonus: 8% of sub-advocates' revenue
├─ Bonus multiplier: High-value contractors ($50+/mo) earn +35% commission
│  (Can go up to 35% for premium contractors or long-term renewals)
```

### Residual Income Example

**Advocate "MarRod8125" signs up contractors:**

```
Month 1-3:
├─ Contractor A ($35/mo): $35 × 0.15 × 3 = $15.75
├─ Contractor B ($25/mo): $25 × 0.15 × 3 = $11.25
├─ Contractor C ($40/mo, premium): $40 × 0.35 × 3 = $42
└─ TOTAL UPFRONT: $69 (first 3 months)

Month 4 (Auto-renewal, passive income starts):
├─ Contractor A renewal: $35 × 0.15 = $5.25/mo FOREVER
├─ Contractor B renewal: $25 × 0.15 = $3.75/mo FOREVER
├─ Contractor C renewal: $40 × 0.35 = $14/mo FOREVER
└─ TOTAL RECURRING: $23/mo, 100% passive

Month 24 (After 2 years, 12 contractors recruited):
├─ Cumulative commission: 12 contractors × $23–40/mo avg = $276–480/mo
├─ Annually: $3,312–$5,760
├─ This is insurance-agent-style residual income
└─ Works as long as contractors renew (estimated 70–80% annual retention)
```

### Financial Model: Advocate Commissions

**Conservative (Year 1):**
- Active advocates: **50** (Texas-focused, recruited during launch)
- Average contractors per advocate: **3** (early adoption)
- Average contractor bill: **$32/mo**
- Average commission: 18% across tiers
- Commission per advocate per month: 3 × $32 × 0.18 = **$17.28/mo**
- Total advocate commission payout: 50 × $17.28 = **$864/mo**
- Annual: **$10,368**

**Realistic (Year 1, Month 9-12):**
- Active advocates: **100** (expanding into 5 states)
- Average contractors per advocate: **5** (maturation)
- Average contractor bill: **$32/mo**
- Average commission: 20% (some reaching Tier 2)
- Commission per advocate per month: 5 × $32 × 0.20 = **$32/mo**
- Total advocate commission payout: 100 × $32 = **$3,200/mo**
- Annual: **~$38,400**

**Stretch (Year 2):**
- Active advocates: **200–300**
- Average contractors per advocate: **8–12** (mature advocates)
- Commission: 22–25% (mix of Tier 2/3)
- Commission per advocate per month: 10 × $32 × 0.23 = **$73.60/mo**
- Total payout: 250 × $73.60 = **$18,400/mo**
- Annual: **~$220,800**

## REVENUE STREAM 3: LEAD CONVERSION (OPTIONAL, Future)

When a homeowner connects with a contractor for an estimate:

```
USER REQUEST: "I need estimates for roof repair"
MaxClaim: "Here are 3-5 contractors in your area, based on your claim"

LEAD MONETIZATION (Optional for contractors)
├─ Contractor can opt-in to per-lead fee (5–10% of job value)
├─ Only charged if job closes (success-based)
├─ Tracked via MaxClaim platform integration
├─ Example: $5,000 roof job → $250–$500 commission to MaxClaim
└─ Conservative estimate: 10–15% of routed leads convert
   → $5,000 claims/mo × 0.12 = $600 leads × 0.15 close rate × $300 avg = $27K/mo

INITIAL YEAR: Conservative = $0 (don't count this)
YEAR 2+: Model as 5–10% of primary ad + advocate revenue once mature
```

---

## REVENUE STREAM 4: B2B SaaS (Future, Year 2+)

```
WHITE-LABEL FOR ADJUSTERS / PUBLIC ADJUSTERS

PUBLIC ADJUSTER FIRM (e.g., "Texas Claims Recovery LLC")
├─ Per-seat license: $299–999/month (depends on volume)
├─ Use case: White-label MaxClaim for their clients
├─ Features: Audit reports branded for firm, partner directory, 1099 tracking
└─ Conservative: 2–3 firms in Year 1 @ $500/mo avg = $12K/year

INSURANCE ADJUSTER ASSOCIATION
├─ Integration: API access for their members
├─ Revenue: Per-claim referral (TBD structure)
└─ Conservative: Year 2+ only

INITIAL YEAR: $0 (minimal SaaS revenue)
YEAR 2+: Model as 5–15% of primary revenue once product mature
```
