## 🎯 THE 5-STEP CONVERSION SYSTEM

Every code task follows this proven process:

### Step 1: EXTRACT (5 minutes)
- **What** am I building?
- **Why** does it matter?
- **Inputs & Outputs** - Example data
- **Dependencies** - What it needs
- **Success Criteria** - How to verify

### Step 2: ARCHITECTURE (10 minutes)
- **Data Structures** - Input/output formats
- **Algorithm** - How processing happens (plain English)
- **Function Signature** - What the code looks like
- **Error Cases** - What goes wrong
- **Performance** - Speed/scale targets

### Step 3: CODE (30 minutes)
- **Production Code** - Ready to copy/paste
- **JSDoc Comments** - Every function documented
- **Input Validation** - Checks for bad data
- **Error Handling** - Graceful degradation
- **Examples** - How to use it

### Step 4: TESTS (20 minutes)
- **Unit Tests** - Happy path + edge cases
- **Self-Tests** - In-code verification
- **Distribution Tests** - For probabilistic functions
- **Commands** - How to run tests
- **Coverage** - >80% code coverage

### Step 5: DEPLOY (10 minutes)
- **File Paths** - Exactly where to put code
- **Import Statements** - How to use it
- **Integration Examples** - Real code snippets
- **Test Commands** - bash commands to verify
- **Checklist** - Before going live

**Total Time: ~75 minutes per task**
**Result: Production-ready, fully tested code**

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### Why This System Works

1. **Requirements are Specific**
   - Not vague ("build a dashboard")
   - Specific ("show partner leads with real-time updates, sorted by status")
   - Testable ("API returns <100ms response time")

2. **Architecture is Detailed**
   - Data structures defined
   - Algorithm described in plain English
   - Error cases identified
   - Performance targets set

3. **Code is Production-Ready**
   - No modifications needed
   - Copy and paste directly
   - Fully commented (JSDoc)
   - All error cases handled

4. **Tests Prove Correctness**
   - Unit tests (happy path)
   - Edge case tests
   - Self-tests in code
   - Distribution tests (probabilistic)
   - All must pass before deploy

5. **Deployment is Documented**
   - Exact file paths
   - Import statements provided
   - Integration examples
   - Test commands
   - Pre-flight checklist

### Why Estimates Are Accurate

The 75-minute estimate per task comes from:
- **Extract: 5 min** - Clear requirements → fast extraction
- **Architecture: 10 min** - Simple algorithm → quick design
- **Code: 30 min** - JSDoc template + error handling patterns
- **Tests: 20 min** - Template-based test structure
- **Deploy: 10 min** - Checklist-based verification

**Actual complexity varies (30-120 min per task), but average is ~75 min**
